pyuv_tornado
============
pyuv_tornado is a wrapper of pyuv so it is usable from within tornado's
event loop.  The purpose is to deal with a few things that tornado doesn't
handle, such as asynchronous file operations.


Installation
============
To install:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

pyuv_tornado requires installation of pyuv and tornado as well.
